# CostmapNoROS

This repo aims to create a costmap without ROS dependencies. The Python files will use sample point cloud data and generate occupancy grids from a global view. 

Sample point cloud data: https://geoslam.com/us/sample-data/
Info on occupancy grids: https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ug/occupancy-grids.html

Future features:
- allow users to control the local frame
